# Final-Project


Your final project submission would normally include an in class demonstration. Instead you will need to arrange with me a time with me before the semester is over to demonstrate what your code does, and how it does it. I will review your demonstration, and review your code that you submit through Git Hub. This will be worth 250 points

    Overview and reflection---a report that describes the following (included as a readme.md file in your final submission)
        [10 pts] A summary of your ultimate aspiration for the project
        [10 pts] A summary of why the project is interesting to you.
        [5 pts] A summary of what portion of the project you actually attempted and completed for this submission.
        [10 pts] A reflection on what you learned from the project.
    Diagrams---at least one example of each of the following to help describe parts of your project and design:
        [5 pts] flow chart
        [5 pts] pseudo code
        [5 pts] use-case diagram
    [20 points] Comments---file headers, comments on method signatures, and inline comments where helpful
    [20 points] Tests---at least 2 of your methods should have corresponding automatic tests cases (using NUnit or Debug.Assert)
    Implementation---your code will be graded according to the following rubric:
        [90 pts]: completed project of sufficient scope (should be roughly the size of 3-4 of the 1405 lab assignments)
        style
            [10 pts] meaningful identifiers
            [10 pts] quality whitespace
        [50 pts]: required elements (appropriately use and explain your use of at least 10 of the following concepts)
            const
            pass-by-reference (in/ref/out)
            arrays
            List or other collections
            2d or jagged arrays
            if/else
            switch
            at least 2 methods
            at least 2 more methods
            while/do-while
            for
            foreach
            reading from a file
            writing to a file
            string formatting
            input from the user
            tuples
            parallel arrays or lists
